# EasySLR - Sign Language Recognition Application

## Architecture Overview

EasySLR is a modern web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase, designed to provide sign language recognition and learning capabilities. The application follows a well-structured architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **API Layer**: Next.js API Routes

## Page Implementations

### 1. Home Page (`/pages/index.tsx`)
- Landing page of the application
- Provides an overview of the application's features
- Includes navigation to key features and authentication

### 2. Login Page (`/pages/login.tsx`)
- Handles user authentication
- Implements Supabase authentication
- Provides login form with email/password authentication
- Includes social authentication options

### 3. Profile Page (`/pages/profile.tsx`)
- User profile management
- Displays user information and preferences
- Allows users to update their profile settings
- Integrates with Supabase for data persistence

### 4. Authentication Pages (`/pages/auth/`)
- Handles various authentication flows
- Includes password reset functionality
- Manages email verification
- Implements protected routes

## Key Components

### Authentication
- Implemented using Supabase Auth
- Secure session management
- Protected route handling
- User state persistence

### Database Integration
- Supabase as the backend service
- Real-time data synchronization
- Secure data access patterns
- Optimized queries and relationships

### API Layer
- Next.js API routes for server-side operations
- Secure endpoint implementation
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Data validation and sanitization

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
- Create a `.env.local` file with required Supabase credentials
- Configure other necessary environment variables

3. Start the development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment using SST (Serverless Stack). The deployment process is automated through the CI/CD pipeline.

## Security Considerations

- All API routes are protected with appropriate authentication
- Sensitive data is encrypted
- CORS policies are properly configured
- Input validation is implemented throughout the application

## Performance Optimizations

- Image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Efficient data fetching patterns
- Caching strategies implemented
